    "Since 2013, Venezuela has been experiencing a humanitarian crisis as a result of socioeconomic and political tensions. This has caused widespread poverty and massive shortages of basic necessities, including food and healthcare. National blackouts and power failures, as well as vaccine, equipment, and medication shortages have caused mortality rates to soar. Over 4 million people, or about 10% of Venezuela’s total population, have fled the country. About 30% of medical professionals leave the country, particularly young doctors. \n",

This is a data collection and storage platform, allowing hospital personnel across the region to input data weekly, and NGOs focusing on the Venezuelan crisis to make effective, data-driven decisions.<br><br>\n",

They need information on the requirements and potential impact for each hospital and region. They need to be able to filter technical topics in the dashboards to allocate specific budgets for different solutions, such as the needs for specific medicine and equipment. They also need to be able to filter for time, hospital and region. After exploring the data we decided to focus on the scarcity of supplies and equipment, operability of services and data quality. Descriptions are given in the comments on feature engineering."
